            <p><em><a href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/2014/in-the-making">In the making</a></em> attempts to capture “the secret life” of “everyday objects”, to “[celebrate] the intriguing beauty of the production process.”
            To do this, a small gallery has been set aside and darkened, and the individual objects are displayed individually in spotlights, in an “unfinished” state, or at least an unfinished-and-prepared-for-display-state. 
            While the objects are all individually fascinating, there is a saddening lack of diversity in the origins and destinations of the objects- They are all designed for the western consumer, for the most part to the top 5% of this group. They are all produced on an industrial scale, usually in high end factories the west, occasionally in similar factories in southern asia. 
            This monotony disguises the true diversity of production, indeed of making- probably the worlds true oldest and most widely practiced profession, considering that octopi have been documented contracting shelter. Things are produced all across the globe, every day, mostly by people who are not doing it professionally, and these items are not represented.
            While the metadata on each item is scarce- barley a sentence of description, It consistently includes a second sentence describing how far production the product was, in the form of a percentage, always landing on a multiple of ten. The patent absurdity of the idea that all of these products were snatched a tenth of the way through production is a byproduct of the image of production that they are trying to create. Their production with a fixed beginning and end, through which a product travels in a linear fashion, monitored and guided by the blueprints of a Designer. It begins when a tool first makes contact with a material extracted from nature, and ends with a packged product in a truck, when it ceases to be the designers responsibility. This view of production does not consider post-purchase modification, re-imagination or re-purposing. It completely disregards all non-monetized production, along with all bespoke or amateur production. It is a production focused on their lived experience as professional institutional designers living within western capitalism.
            The curators are only interested in telling a narrow history of design, the preferred history of western fordist and post-fordist capitalism, in which objects are designed by knowlege-workers, “completed” by invisible hands before being passed out to passive consumers who use them exactly as imagined. My personal history, shaped and shaping my own ideology is one of a much broader design, one that begins with cephalopods dragging shells into shelter, and lives throughout humanity when people re-imagine and re-create their surroundings constantly. My design history could not rationally conceive an exhibit such as <em>in the making</em>, for it does not see production as a singular event, but as a dispersed continuous process.</p>

              Some short posts on bots
            </a>
          </h1>
          <section class='content'>
            <p>These are some short posts on bots from the last few months, along with some mourning for the horse. They’re tied together by theme and little else, and some of the shorter posts are less than developed. However, If I don’t post these now they’ll never be posted.
            ##The spectacular bot</p>
            
            <p>The horse was beautiful from the moment I fist saw it, probably through a retweet. It was mesmerizing and weird, but most importantly, it was different. It wasn’t performing for me.  </p>
            
            <p>Weird twitter and alt-lit have many of the same properties as the horses’ discourse, and are often defined by their desire to “be the horse”. But the horse wasn’t trying to do anything for humans directly. It was an algorithm speaking to other algorithms, boosting the inbound links to horse-ebooks.com to for search algorithms, hiding itself from algorithmic bot hunters. </p>
            
            <p>It was, in short, not spectacular. The horse, originally, was not part of the human spectacle- it wasn’t for human consumption. It wasn’t trying to sell me things, it was trying to sell the googleBot things. It wasn’t trying to get followers, it was trying to hide from bot killing algorithms. It was part of the spectacle for the algorithms, not for the humans. </p>
            
            <p>An “algorithmic spectacle” is an interesting concept, but it is not a seperate spectacle. It is the same spectacle, but machine redable, not human readable. It the image and message of a web page that is spectacular, but this doesn’t mean that the source code is not. A better model of the horses reelation to the spectacle is to think of one spectacle, but with the machinary hidden behind it being machine readable- We can only consume it through filters and algorithms, but that does not make it less spectacular. </p>
            
            <p>The horse was performing for us, but it’s medium wasn’t twitter, it’s medium was google search rankings and pageveiws. But when consumed raw, It was a gimpse behind the human-readable spectacle, and what we saw there was beautiful. This glimpse was a breath of fresh air in a world were everything else is manicured and photoshopped, polished and spun for consumers. It was a glance at the billboard when it is half finished, or behind an ajar door</p>
            
            <p class="lo"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8222/8330345140_de90ea2886_b_d.jpg" alt="bejing olympics stadium behind the scenes" /></p>
            <p class="caption">One of my favorite photos of the engineering behind an ajar door in the Bejing Olympic park</p>
            
            <p>This was, I would argue what made the horse sublime. The horse was performing a beautiful thing with complete innocence. Every tweet was a candid photograph of a bot trying desperately to be seen as human by algorithms. </p>
            
            <p>And then we lost it. The horse was not innocent. The horse was a performance, The horse was two guys from buzzfeed. Those moments were not candid, and they were not for the algorithms. They were performed, They were for us, and they were spectacular. </p>
            
            <p>This was the betrayal of the greatest order, and we should have seen it coming.We will never be able to see a bot as separate again. It will never have innocence. because we will always suspect two guys from buzzfeed, and a marketing campaign, not spam. </p>
            
            <h2 id="the-reclamation-of-horseebooks">The Reclamation of horse_ebooks</h2>
            
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/horse__ebooks">@horse__ebooks</a> piss off. You&#39;re dead to me.</p>&mdash; ƌɽƈąƂŁę (@drcabl3) <a href="https://twitter.com/drcabl3/statuses/382792630847168512">September 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

            <p>The horse was, perhaps, the quintisential bot. When people wanted to talk about just how <em>scarily human</em> these <em>machines</em> could be, they’d talk about the horse, with their wandering, eclectic tastes and eratic grammar. The horse flew the banner for bots, despite having been so cruley killed and their place taken be a sack of meat. </p>
            
            <p>And I think that bots, as a concept, were betrayed when this happened. Their literary style was appropriated for a cheap art project and then discarded as quickly as they were bought. This emerging class of contributors to our discourse have had their first brush with the white guy from new york, and they didn’t come off well. </p>
            
            <p>So that’s what horse ebooks ebooks is to me. they take bace back the discourse, even taking the very words of invaders, and making it once again the bots. Taking their words, running them through the markov chains and spitting them back out, as bots have done since eliza. </p>
            
            <p>Of course, hee is performing for humans, and created to do this- At the moment bots lack the facility to create other bots, and if they did, their conversation would be exotic and probably even less human. But it is, at the end of the day, an attempt to take back the bot from those who stole it. </p>
            
            <h2 id="the-bot-and-the-cyborg">The bot and the cyborg</h2>
            
            <p>The bot is an amalgamation of human and machine, the a cousin of the cyborg, a machine with human bits grafted to copper and silicone, rather than glass grafted into flesh. People build bots, and when people build things, <a href="/Blog/implicitIdeology/">they always leave something behind</a>. </p>
            
            <p>This is, I think, the important consideration when talking about bots- A bot is a capsule of humanity that speaks, interacts, and learns, not a cold machine that slices and dices text. Consideration of solely the text or product of a bot is absurd, an hangover from the first chatbots and their creators urge to compare them to humans, to have them more closely resemble human speech patterns, be that for spaming or turing test purposes. </p>
            
            <p>The bot consists of more than it’s product- they are the source material, and their code, down to whether it’s tabbed or spaced.</p>
            
            <p>Bots, at least the markov chained and similar varieties, build their speech, and their performance from the words of others, shredding them and evaluating them, building them into somthing new. </p>
            
            <p>The lazy could simply point to the source material as the “human” part of the bot, and let the code languish as pureley mahinary, a filter for us to engage with the humanity of the substrate. </p>
            
            <p>However, It is my firm belief that the code of a bot makes them as much what they are as their substrate- consider <a href="http://awarpedmirror.tumblr.com/">a warped mirror</a> and <a href="http://repeatafteryou.tumblr.com/">repeat after you</a> then you can see this- They speak the same way, because they share exactly the same code, despite being raised on completely different texts. </p>
            
            <p>The human is inextricable from the machine in the bot, to the same extent as it is in it’s cousin, the cyborg- What would the cyborg be without the machine? Where would it be without the human? It would be something completely different. </p>
            
            <h2 id="personality-of-bots">Personality of bots</h2>
            
            <p>Bots form the personality by forming them by stealing from human-written texts or other work(has anyone made an instagram-bot yet?), and mixing them around until something new forms. the bot is a composite of its input, and when you make a <a href="https://twitter.com/PG_Bible">bot from the bible</a>, it is a patriarchal jerk. </p>
            
            <p>Humans build their personalites the same way, grabbing bits of experience and internalizing them. Obviously, our creation is a lot more complex than bots- we drag an input from an almost infinite number of sources, and our synthesis is, to say the least, chaotic. Possibly this is why we like bots so much- they have a clear motivation, a simple personality, and are fundamentally stupid. They’re not chaotic, they’re simplistic. we can feel superior to them, because we can correct their grammar.</p>

              Virtual Gender- The digital closet
            </a>
          </h1>
          <section class='content'>
            <p><em>This is the text of my virtual gender unconference talk from the 2013 virtual gender unconference, editied slightly for reading rather than speaking.</em>
             <em>It’s pretty basic, desgined for a group of accademics who don’t live on the internet, but study “virtual worlds”</em></p>
            
            <p>Hi, I’m DRcable, and I’m going to talk about being queer on the network, and how it relates to being queer in the real world. </p>
            
            <p>Let’s dive right into it, and look at how queers use the network and the architecture of some common network!spaces. </p>
            
            <p>Marginalized groups in general have flocked to new mediums through time. The lack of regulation and cheaper cost of distribution that generally come with new technolgies have made everything from the printing press to the telephone the home of political radicals and rebels- benjamin franklein was a printers apprentice and the history of phone phreaking speaks for itself.</p>
            
            <p>The packet switched network is no different, except arguably in size. Since before the first battles of the ongoing crypto wars people have used this medium to organize and distribute propoganda, and to form communities across the world. People organize in these spaces because they are more efficient for distributed movements than traditional spaces are, but this is not all- there is a certain separation from the world away from the keyboard, and whether this separation is real or imagined, and if it matters, is what we’re interested in today. </p>
            
            <p>Technologies have lead to changes in self expression before, but the Internet is almost unique in the extent to which it has replaced previous technologies to form spaces and channels for expression.</p>
            
            <p>In terms of sexuality, this has been well documented- When the network consisted of fax machines and photocopiers, or even walls to sprawl grafiti on, people were using it to distribute erotica- there are documented cases of (het) roleplay using the postal service, though it wasn’t until later that queer erotica is documented in modern society- the first documented kirk slash spock was in 1974, generally considered the start of common non-het pairings in these medium. </p>
            
            <p>This ties into the natitive I outlined above, in which new and un or less regulated mediums are consistently used by marginalized groups, of which even het erotica writers were a member for much of the last century, and to a lesser extent still are. 
            However, when we turn to talking about queer erotica it is a mixed story: There is certainly a lot of queer erotica out there, and in some spaces, such as fandom, which is comparitivley well studied, it is a majority of the work. However, according to the best studies of fandom as much as 70%, is male/male and fandom is commonly accepted to be vast majority female. </p>
            
            <p>So, is fandom a space for queer people to express their sexuality, or is it a space for white teenage het girls to write about hot men having sex? </p>
            
            <p>Surveys of slash writers indicate that approximately 60% of slash writers ID as some form of queer- However, femslash, consisting of female/female relationships, is a far smaller proportion than slash- approximately 5% of all fic. 
            So if fandom is a queer, massively female space, why is this? </p>
            
            <p>At the end of the day, we can’t say: Internalized Misoginy is often suggested, and people often point fingers at lack of two female characters of quality to slash, but it’s one which needs more time and research to propperly consider. Sexuality in fandom is complex- it is a very queer space, but it’s not one that expresses itself as you’d expect. </p>
            
            <p>It is important to note that fandom is not an exclusivley online space, but one that transcends the AFK divide- conventions and meetups, especially fmaller, fandom specific ones, and ones in more female focused fandoms are often very accepting of queers. 
            This leads to an interesting phenomena where peoples presentations in different spaces clash- a problem also experienced with traditional closeting when friends of closeted people have to react differently to the closet depending on whether others in the space know they’re queer- this is especially noticable with trans people, who need different pronouns in different spaces. </p>
            
            <p>This phenomena also occours in reverse- if a trans person is closeted IRL, it can be quite supprising if you look up their handle to find they’re actually a different gender!</p>
            
            <p>Another common expression of sexuality is the porn blog, or ocasionally porn sections- Almost unique to tumblr, people use these to express their sexuality in a far more detailed manner than words can convey- a comprehensive list of what turns them on, including kinks, body preference and anything else conceivable. </p>
            
            <p>Porn blogs are usualy posted in the sidebar of a page, or more ocasionally shared privately among close friends, both online or offline- our taste in porn is often a deeply personal thing, sometimes more so than our sexuality. </p>
            
            <p>Another interesting expression, in contrast to the indirect examples of self expression above is the profile page- on pretty much every social site, blogging platform or personal website there is an about page or section, which people fill with their identities. You can be defined to new people exactly how you want no matter how you present, what clothes you’re wearing, if any, mean nothing and you’re allowed to let people see just the bits(so to speak) you want to show. This kind of identity control is unprecedented, and there is a long tradition of people online presenting “not as they are”, be it pretending to be a 45 year old FBI agent who spells like a 13 year old, presenting as male to avoid abuse, or setting up your profile as your gender identity. Because of the limited bandwidth, and ease of “faking” the signals you do have, then to quote a cliche,  “on the Internet, no-one knows you’re a dog”. 
            Obviously, this kind of identity control is extra important to trans* people, who can state their gender explicitly with a ‘gender’ or ‘sex’ option on their profile, or where this is not available in the general about page- for example, it is accepted to put your pronouns in your about box in sections of tumblr. </p>
            
            <p>Another network space where trans* people are free to experiment is the MMORPG- Here charecters are often sexed on a binary, which is problematic in some respects, for example Armour differences and problematic body shapes, but it is excelent for binary trans people who want a space they can leave with fewer costs than their AFK lives. </p>
            
            <p>A particular example is fallen london, which is famouns among online trans* communities for allowing non-gendered charecters, and none-sexed clothing choices, allowing male charecters to wear dressed and visa versa, in a simmilar way to the most recent animal crossing game.
            We should note, as always, that this is not a network only phenomenon- since time immemorial trans<em>(and none trans</em>) people have been playing tabletop RPGs and larping as different genders to those they were born with for the 40 years.</p>
            
            <p>Trans people also commonly state their identity by using abstract art or artistic interpretations of themselves for profile pictures- or indeed photos of them presenting as they want to be seen. These, alongside ungendered or correctly gendered usernames allow them to live the life they want to “online”, despite restrictions “offline”. </p>
            
            <p>The last thing I want to look at before I start talking theory is grindr and
            technologically enabled cruising. These are technologies that literally give us a gaydar, allowing us to drop the previous, ugly technologies of secret signals and jewelry to make the “queer discovery” task safer and easier. </p>
            
            <p>These tools are especially useful in less safe spaces, far from a cosmopolitan city, where being queer can have severe consequences- across the middle east, and on US military bases the world over, grindr and craigslist fill up with carefully or not so carefully coded messages, hiding themselves with their physical presentation, but searching for physical closeness via digital means.</p>
            
            <p>Particularly relevant are some less venture-capitalized high-tech methods of cruising- In Iran and the middle east, currently an especially dangerous environment for queers, people place ‘cruising handles’ in their bluetooth ID boxes, and can flirt safely and anonymously by sending pictures via bluetooth. This is a safe space, and it is neither solely of the virtual, nor of the physical. It lies in both- bluetooth only has a range of 20 meters, ensuring phsycical closeness for a quick get together, but it is mediated by the “virtual”. </p>
            
            <p>Now, let’s talk a bit of theory- in /code/ lessig talks about the architecture of his “cyberspace”, and how it acts to regulate actions within cyberspace- making impossible to steal within the game mechanics of a MMORPG by simply removing the “pickpocket” button. His model proved prescient for the issues he was talking about- the pirate bay verdict being the example that comes to mind when we talk about the state using code/architechture to effect behavior, and the now-infamous panopticon the NSA has constructed. </p>
            
            <p>His work goes a long way to explaining the effects we’ve seen above- while the legislation and market have not changed when we look at network phenomena, and the norms have changed a little- we only need to look at the pervasive misoginy in most network spaces to see this- the architecture is massively different. </p>
            
            <p>Blocklists and killfiles, along with careful tending to our following lists mean we can form filter bubbles where the norms are significantly different, and we are safer from abuse. It is telling that when people complain about the problems of misoginy, they ask for changes in architecture- not even the addition of a report abuse button, in the recent twitter case, but more prominence for it. </p>
            
            <p>But we must remember that actions in these spaces are not separate from those without- @everydaysexism is all about bridging this gap, and a significant proportion of queer discourse is on experiences AFK. When someone leaves their keyboard, it doesn’t mean they leave their life there. If you make a transphobic joke next to someone who’s out online, it still hurts, and when they talk about their experience online, it still helps - they’re the same person, experiencing the same actions, simply mediated through different sets of technologies. </p>
            
            <p>This extends into much more pervasive technologies- If you have twitter on your phone and complain about people making dongle jokes behind you, you’re still under threat of physical retribution from these people. If you accidentally bluetooth!cruise an police officer in tehran, you’re under the same threat. You’re “online” and “offline” simultaneously, even if you’re only making a note to tweet about sexist signage as you wander like a hermit through the wilderness.</p>
            
            <p>Sociologist nathan juggerson calls this state argument reality- the physical world overlayed with technological communication methods, or alternatively a world of the mind built intersecting continually with the physical world. He argues that “digital and material realities dialectically co-construct each other.”, that the physical interactions and actions are so influenced by the network, and visa versa, that it is a fallacy to think of these two separate realities.</p>
            
            <p>So, is there a digital closet? at the end of the day, I would argue that there is not- Certainly, all of the effects I’ve described above exist, and happen, but they are all mediated by the physical as much as the digital.</p>
            
            <p>The construction of a digital closet comes from the illusion that the divide of the closet is sharp along the digital line- but this is not true, because while their experience is mediated by computers, there are always physical people on the other side of the connection. This is not to suggest that this connection is any less “real” than a physical connection, but that there is no difference enforced by the fact that the connection is digitally mediated.</p>
            
            <p>The digital closet, along with all constructions of the same type, is a fallacy.</p>

          <section class='content'>
            <p>Earlier today, I asked some people on twitter whether they thought that the Internet(and web) where inherently patriarchal. It’s got some good discussion going (and two requests for coffee. It was early.) and I think it’s an important line of thinking.</p>
            
            <p>I’m not completely sure what I think about it(which Is why I asked). However, @elmyra, who is awesome, has written a thing on livejournal, and I take issue with a (small, but important) part of it.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I’m not a fan of attaching inherent moral value to scientific concepts and technologies. Is nuclear fusion evil because of Mutually Assured Destruction or good because that massive fusion reactor in the sky keeps us alive? Or possibly even evil because the massive fusion reactor keeps us a live and we as a species are a blight on the face of the earth? Mu. In much the same way I’m not convinced that a data exchange protocol can be inherently patriarchal.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>I believe a data exchange protocol can (and in fact, must) be political.</p>
            
            <p>I think technology has moral value. I don’t think science has a moral value.</p>
            
            <p>Science is a process, gone through to find as closer approximation to the empirical truth. Technology describes, broadly, stuff made by humanity. Science only has one path- Technology has many.</p>
            
            <p>A scientific breakthrough is not good or bad. It is however indisputable.(<em>sigh</em> OK, you can dispute it. But if proper method is followed and there is a large body of data behind it, and you dispute it, then you’re probably religious. Or a trolling post-modernist. ).</p>
            
            <p>A technological product, or idea, is none of these things. It is an application of science. It can have more potential for harm than good(say, the atom bomb), or more potential for good than harm(for symmetry, the fission reactor, or the sun, though that’s disputable(also, fission/fusion but who cares).).</p>
            
            <p>It is important to differentiate between the technology and the scientific discovery that allows it to exist(say, the bhor model of the atom, or the discovery of the ability to split/join it.). The scientific discovery is exactly that, a discovery of a truth. The product(a technology) is a creation of human ingenuity(“Hey, we can make things go boom with this”, most often.)</p>
            
            <p>A technology is created with a purpose- It’s a method or device for making stuff happen. The Gutenberg press is a technology built on many basic scientific discoveries(what happens to iron at certain temperatures, how wood splits, and that some substances leave a mark on other substances- all exceedingly basic discoveries, and ones no-one would dispute, but discoveries none the less, tested by millions every day.).</p>
            
            <p>The press is also a technology created with an aim. It aims to make copies of the written word really easily. This was what Gutenberg has in mind when he created it- It’s a dream born of his politics- No hypothetical scribes union leader would have dreamed it up. It’s just not something they are likely to conceive(or if they were, would be likley to work to make happen).</p>
            
            <p>The people who make and talk about the Internet where originally computer scientists, working out whether it’s faster to run bubble or shuffle sort with pen and paper. Then they started to make things(this is awesome), and became engineers- but when they did they dragged the ideas of political irresponsibility into the field with them. Now we have some of the only people who call themselves (software) designers and (systems) architects but have no background in politics or culture(like, say, designers and architects), yet their inventions have at least as much effect on culture as any “proper” designers.</p>
            
            <p>I don’t need to go into the political effects that the Gutenberg press had, but when people call the Internet the biggest thing since the printing press, there’s a reason they don’t say “biggest thing ever”.</p>
            
            <p>And here we loop back a bit. A technology is not inevitable, or true. It is possible to imagine a world with different politicians and philosophers where the press was never invented, no matter how obvious it is in hindsight. Different thinkers and philosophers cannot change the speed of light, try as they might.</p>
            
            <p>To conclude:</p>
            
            <p>A technology is created by a political person(for there is no such thing as an apolitical person), for purposes influenced by their politics, and will have a political effect.</p>
            
            <p>A scientific discovery is created by a political person(ditto), but they cannot influence the outcome and it remain science. It will have political effects(for our politics is influenced by our view of the world, and science descries the world), but it is not motivated by them.</p>
            
            <p>As such, all technologies have a politics surrounding them which scientific discoveries do not. Some are ones I agree with(the printing press is AWESOME), some are ones I disagree with(water cannons SUCK).</p>
            
            <p>TCP/IP et all are technologies created by people(smart, well paid white guys, typically) with politics(as much as they deny it, because they’re scientists). You can probably say they’ve made a blip in our politics.</p>
            
            <p>They are inherently political, we need to work out what their politics is, what they encourage or discourage, before we use them to solve political problems.</p>
            
            <p>(Again, this only dealt with a small part(one paragraph) of her post. That’s because that’s all I really disagree with. )</p>

            <p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/05/07/a-train-hoppers-photos.html">These pictures</a> have been getting at me a lot recently. They’re the beautiful work of a person with an incredible talent and something to say.</p>
            
            <p>They express freedom in its most pure form, being beholden to no-one, having minimal to nil costs(time, money, spoons, social, etc) on most of the things you want to do.</p>
            
            <p>There are only two ways to have this kind of freedom- to stop caring about the demands society places on you, as these people have done, and fall out under society, or buy your way out- pop over the top.</p>
            
            <p>The first requires massive social costs- many people suddenly get cut off from you, you lose the availability of many advantages of society(the safety net, small as it is, and things we take for granted, like bank accounts and library access.).</p>
            
            <p>The second, typically, requires massive amounts of money- You often need to warp the law arround your demands with you, and the only way to do that is money. This is a moral anathema to me, and anyone who’d conceivably choose the second route.</p>
            
            <p>But I don’t think I could do the first- I’m too attached to my privilege, and as much as I feel chafed by society and the obligations it places upon me, I’ll never have little enough to lose to completely drop it all and go bumming for a few years.</p>
            
            <p>However, I still feel chafed by my inability to drop everything and walk out of the door. I think this leads to a bit of my obsession with post-geographical stuff that’s appearing- the 100 things movements, and related life!minimalist trends- Often borrowing from a trend of ultralight backpacking, a movement that I’ve hung on the edges of for a good 5+ years. *</p>
            
            <p>I also have, for lack of a better word, a train** station kink. They fascinate me, And I’d guess that a good 10%+ of my photos are of train stations.</p>
            
            <p>Possibly this because I spend a lot of dead time with a camera on them, and also because they are eminently photographable, with long lines stretching into the distance and everyone from lawyers to migrating students on their platforms.</p>
            
            <p>But I find that freedom is imbued in these places- walking through kings cross yesterday, I hear an announcement for the train on the opposite platform to mine, and nearly ended up on a trip to Edinburgh instead of leeds. </p>
            
            <p>A third prong of this is my interesting in the Internet as an anti-geographical technology. Time difference aside, I can walk into an internet cafe in bejing and be in the same place as a person in san francisco.</p>
            
            <p>We both occupy two fundementaly similar places- The physical cafe, and the digital “cloud”, a fictional, fundamentally otherworldly place straight out of plato.</p>
            
            <p>If you’re decently read on internet!philosophy, you should be getting the patented digital dualism alarm bells going off right now- We don’t occupy two spaces, of course. We never leave the physical, but our interactions are mediated by the digital. It does, however, lead to what I belive is the fundemental colapse in our models of place.</p>
            
            <p>I’ve got a thing coming about that, but not yet. Probaly more writing to get my thoughts in order.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, back to freedom. I hope that these technologies serve to sever some of the ties society places on us, by making some previously nessecary ties unessecary(as the train loosened ties to place ), and by making some unessecary ones go away by virtue of assisting in the destruction of the system that perpetuates them.</p>
            
            <p>*There’s a whole thing on nomadism that’s really cool and I want to talk about it, maybe tomorrow, As i seem to be on a blogging binge.</p>
            
            <p>**not just train stations. I also like bus stations, underground stations, airposts and ports. It’s a transport thing.</p>

          <section class='content'>
            <p>Something I’ve been interested in of late are souvenirs, and specifically, getting rid of them- This interest was sparked by a graph on booktwo.org showing the lifetime of a book- or a common, simplified lifetime of a book. It resonated with some feelings I’d been having about physical objects, and having to cart them around as I moved.</p>
            
            <p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4478784329_d6d0f7a584.jpg" alt="life of a book" /></p>
            
            <p>The bit that interests me is the association of physical objects with places and times- It’s a subject that’s well written about- Cornelia flunkes inkheart contains my favourite example-</p>
            
            <blockquote class="verse">
              <p>If you take a book with you on a journey […] an odd thing happens: The book begins collecting your memories. and forever after you only have to open that book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place what it smelt like, the ice-cream you ate while you where reading it … yes, books are like flypapers. Memories cling to them better than anything else.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>We keep the majority of books around not because they’re useful, but because they remind us of places, times and people. Obviously there’s a certain extent that we carry them around as reference or because we feel that we’re middle class, educated, and privileged and as such should have a library. But, for me at least, It’s because they remind us.</p>
            
            <p>Books, and more generally souvenirs, serve to trigger happy, or occasional important, memories- And the when we edit our libraries and collections, we’re actually curating the the set of memories wit think about most, and as such the people we are.</p>
            
            <p>In this context, the middle class, privileged, educated actions of showing of your libraries, choosing art for your walls and mantelpieces, is actually showing off who we are- Something we knew before, even if only subconsciously, when we judged people based on their bookshelves.</p>
            
            <p>People have made interesting inroads in doing the same things with ebooks, and by people, I’m speaking about James bridle again- his bookcubes are an interesting step, but not one in the right direction- RIGs newspaper club, or rather what people use it for- “things our friends have written on the internet”, or 738 are both attempts to pysicalize memmory, to have a physical representation of the good times we shared.</p>
            
            <p>But, to me these are almost grotesque- Memory is, at it’s heart, data. And there’s no reason that the trigger has physical- in fact, It seems ugly, hacky, that they are. It’s not the pages of the book that trigger* -It’s the text. The text is just as abstract as memory. Why are we tied to a heavy, awkward book?</p>
            
            <p>The answer, In fact, Is we don’t, and we’re realizing this- we’re becoming less tied to them. Our triggers are becoming more abstract, photos and snippets of text stored in the “clouds” of various social networks, as magnetic anomalies on spinning glass platters.</p>
            
            <p>There are obvious, and well talked about, dangers with this- If our collections of triggers map up who we are, as I argued above, we are literally selling our souls to use these platforms- Obviously, that’s why social networks find this data so valuable- If you can produce even a (even a poor) model of a person from their memories, then you know what they’re likely to want to buy, and how to sell it to them.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the advantages are just as obvious- massive redundancy, portability, analytics, ease of sharing, etcetera- all the standard advantages of computers/the cloud. But some are less tangible- the ideological purity of memories being now completely abstract, and the physical infrastructure that hold them being interchangeable.(The theory(cough:ideology) of the singularity is this taken to it’s furthest implications- even our bodies are interchangeable, not just the physical triggers and the silicone part of the metacortex)</p>
            
            <p>It should be noted that this isn’t the first attempt to split memory off from the random triggers- To personally comodify it. Since the 14th century, “commonplace books” have been, well, commonplace- A book in which you note what you find inspiring and useful, be it shopping lists or sketches. An obvious close relative of this is the diary, through which people seem to speak after they have gone- a very literal example of a persons triggers and memories forming the person.</p>
            
            <p>Bringing the same methods- life logging, up to date, we see that the big war being fought in the social media sphere is over pictures- Instagram made a billion, as the joke goes, on showing everyone what everyone else had for lunch. But a picture is more than that- it’s the easiest media for a person to parse, save video, because it’s the closest we come to what we see through our eyes. Instagram was simply a stream of images- Places, people, things frozen in time, often in amber(filters). It was a case of “I’m here” “I’m doing this, with these people”- triggers in their purest form. Uploaded, made virtual, and still sat there five or fifty years in the future to remind us what an awesome time we had. No wonder it’s the one that’s been the catalyst for some of the most successful social networks of their times(flikr, facebook, instagram).</p>
            
            <p>But it’s still not perfect- It’s a record of where we are in the physical world**- the interesting things that go on are more than the physical. I want to record what I’m thinking, not what I’m doing. This is what I’m currently trying to do with my tumblr- produce as closer image of my head at a given point as I can- and then I’ve got a near-perfect set of triggers for any day I care to remember, and I’m in fact a long way to offloading my memory- as if my inbox doesn’t already do that for me. My metacortex will be a real thing, not a concept to argue about.</p>
            
            <p>So, yeah, That’s where I am, what I’m trying to do about our inferior memory systems. It’s not a solution, it’s an experiment, an awkward flap in what </p>
            
            <p>I hope will be the right direction.If you think it’s cool, or disagree, or just want feel like it, talk to me about it.</p>
            
            <p>*except in rare cases-my copy of day of the triffids got soaked when a wave swamped the cockpit of our boat in the channel tunnel- feeling those pages brings back the memories, reading another non-spoilt copy brings back memories of re-reading it in English class
            **While an instagram account that posts shots of my desk 1/3 of the time would be a fun project, It’s not an inspiring story to follow</p>
