          <h1>
            Remebering in the digital age
          </h1>
          <p>Something I’ve been interested in of late are souvenirs, and specifically, getting rid of them- This interest was sparked by a graph on booktwo.org showing the lifetime of a book- or a common, simplified lifetime of a book. It resonated with some feelings I’d been having about physical objects, and having to cart them around as I moved.</p>
          
          <p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4478784329_d6d0f7a584.jpg" alt="life of a book" /></p>
          
          <p>The bit that interests me is the association of physical objects with places and times- It’s a subject that’s well written about- Cornelia flunkes inkheart contains my favourite example-</p>
          
          <blockquote class="verse">
            <p>If you take a book with you on a journey […] an odd thing happens: The book begins collecting your memories. and forever after you only have to open that book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place what it smelt like, the ice-cream you ate while you where reading it … yes, books are like flypapers. Memories cling to them better than anything else.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>We keep the majority of books around not because they’re useful, but because they remind us of places, times and people. Obviously there’s a certain extent that we carry them around as reference or because we feel that we’re middle class, educated, and privileged and as such should have a library. But, for me at least, It’s because they remind us.</p>
          
          <p>Books, and more generally souvenirs, serve to trigger happy, or occasional important, memories- And the when we edit our libraries and collections, we’re actually curating the the set of memories wit think about most, and as such the people we are.</p>
          
          <p>In this context, the middle class, privileged, educated actions of showing of your libraries, choosing art for your walls and mantelpieces, is actually showing off who we are- Something we knew before, even if only subconsciously, when we judged people based on their bookshelves.</p>
          
          <p>People have made interesting inroads in doing the same things with ebooks, and by people, I’m speaking about James brindle again- his bookcubes are an interesting step, but not one in the right direction- RIGs newspaper club, or rather what people use it for- “things our friends have written on the internet”, or 738 are both attempts to pysicalize memmory, to have a physical representation of the good times we shared.</p>
          
          <p>But, to me these are almost grotesque- Memory is, at it’s heart, data. And there’s no reason that the trigger has physical- in fact, It seems ugly, hacky, that they are. It’s not the pages of the book that trigger* -It’s the text. The text is just as abstract as memory. Why are we tied to a heavy, awkward book?</p>
          
          <p>The answer, In fact, Is we don’t, and we’re realizing this- we’re becoming less tied to them. Our triggers are becoming more abstract, photos and snippets of text stored in the “clouds” of various social networks, as magnetic anomalies on spinning glass platters.</p>
          
          <p>There are obvious, and well talked about, dangers with this- If our collections of triggers map up who we are, as I argued above, we are literally selling our souls to use these platforms- Obviously, that’s why social networks find this data so valuable- If you can produce even a (even a poor) model of a person from their memories, then you know what they’re likely to want to buy, and how to sell it to them.</p>
          
          <p>Some of the advantages are just as obvious- massive redundancy, portability, analytics, ease of sharing, etcetera- all the standard advantages of computers/the cloud. But some are less tangible- the ideological purity of memories being now completely abstract, and the physical infrastructure that hold them being interchangeable.(The theory(cough:ideology) of the singularity is this taken to it’s furthest implications- even our bodies are interchangeable, not just the physical triggers and the silicone part of the metacortex)</p>
          
          <p>It should be noted that this isn’t the first attempt to split memory off from the random triggers- To personally comodify it. Since the 14th century, “commonplace books” have been, well, commonplace- A book in which you note what you find inspiring and useful, be it shopping lists or sketches. An obvious close relative of this is the diary, through which people seem to speak after they have gone- a very literal example of a persons triggers and memories forming the person.</p>
          
          <p>Bringing the same methods- life logging, up to date, we see that the big war being fought in the social media sphere is over pictures- Instagram made a billion, as the joke goes, on showing everyone what everyone else had for lunch. But a picture is more than that- it’s the easiest media for a person to parse, save video, because it’s the closest we come to what we see through our eyes. Instagram was simply a stream of images- Places, people, things frozen in time, often in amber(filters). It was a case of “I’m here” “I’m doing this, with these people”- triggers in their purest form. Uploaded, made virtual, and still sat there five or fifty years in the future to remind us what an awesome time we had. No wonder it’s the one that’s been the catalyst for some of the most successful social networks of their times(flikr, facebook, instagram).</p>
          
          <p>But it’s still not perfect- It’s a record of where we are in the physical world**- the interesting things that go on are more than the physical. I want to record what I’m thinking, not what I’m doing. This is what I’m currently trying to do with my tumblr- produce as closer image of my head at a given point as I can- and then I’ve got a near-perfect set of triggers for any day I care to remember, and I’m in fact a long way to offloading my memory- as if my inbox doesn’t already do that for me. My metacortex will be a real thing, not a concept to argue about.</p>
          
          <p>So, yeah, That’s where I am, what I’m trying to do about our inferior memory systems. It’s not a solution, it’s an experiment, an awkward flap in what </p>
          
          <p>I hope will be the right direction.If you think it’s cool, or disagree, or just want feel like it, talk to me about it.</p>
          
          <p>*except in rare cases-my copy of day of the triffids got soaked when a wave swamped the cockpit of our boat in the channel tunnel- feeling those pages brings back the memories, reading another non-spoilt copy brings back memories of re-reading it in English class
          **While an instagram account that posts shots of my desk 1/3 of the time would be a fun project, It’s not an inspiring story to follow</p>
