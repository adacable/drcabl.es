          <h1>
            Implicit Ideology
          </h1>
          <p>Earlier today, I asked some people on twitter whether they thought that the Internet(and web) where inherently patriarchal. It’s got some good discussion going (and two requests for coffee. It was early.) and I think it’s an important line of thinking.</p>
          
          <p>I’m not completely sure what I think about it(which Is why I asked). However, @elmyra, who is awesome, has written a thing on livejournal, and I take issue with a (small, but important) part of it.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>I’m not a fan of attaching inherent moral value to scientific concepts and technologies. Is nuclear fusion evil because of Mutually Assured Destruction or good because that massive fusion reactor in the sky keeps us alive? Or possibly even evil because the massive fusion reactor keeps us a live and we as a species are a blight on the face of the earth? Mu. In much the same way I’m not convinced that a data exchange protocol can be inherently patriarchal.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>I believe a data exchange protocol can (and in fact, must) be political.</p>
          
          <p>I think technology has moral value. I don’t think science has a moral value.</p>
          
          <p>Science is a process, gone through to find as closer approximation to the empirical truth. Technology describes, broadly, stuff made by humanity. Science only has one path- Technology has many.</p>
          
          <p>A scientific breakthrough is not good or bad. It is however indisputable.(<em>sigh</em> OK, you can dispute it. But if proper method is followed and there is a large body of data behind it, and you dispute it, then you’re probably religious. Or a trolling post-modernist. ).</p>
          
          <p>A technological product, or idea, is none of these things. It is an application of science. It can have more potential for harm than good(say, the atom bomb), or more potential for good than harm(for symmetry, the fission reactor, or the sun, though that’s disputable(also, fission/fusion but who cares).).</p>
          
          <p>It is important to differentiate between the technology and the scientific discovery that allows it to exist(say, the bhor model of the atom, or the discovery of the ability to split/join it.). The scientific discovery is exactly that, a discovery of a truth. The product(a technology) is a creation of human ingenuity(“Hey, we can make things go boom with this”, most often.)</p>
          
          <p>A technology is created with a purpose- It’s a method or device for making stuff happen. The Gutenberg press is a technology built on many basic scientific discoveries(what happens to iron at certain temperatures, how wood splits, and that some substances leave a mark on other substances- all exceedingly basic discoveries, and ones no-one would dispute, but discoveries none the less, tested by millions every day.).</p>
          
          <p>The press is also a technology created with an aim. It aims to make copies of the written word really easily. This was what Gutenberg has in mind when he created it- It’s a dream born of his politics- No hypothetical scribes union leader would have dreamed it up. It’s just not something they are likely to conceive(or if they were, would be likley to work to make happen).</p>
          
          <p>The people who make and talk about the Internet where originally computer scientists, working out whether it’s faster to run bubble or shuffle sort with pen and paper. Then they started to make things(this is awesome), and became engineers- but when they did they dragged the ideas of political irresponsibility into the field with them. Now we have some of the only people who call themselves (software) designers and (systems) architects but have no background in politics or culture(like, say, designers and architects), yet their inventions have at least as much effect on culture as any “proper” designers.</p>
          
          <p>I don’t need to go into the political effects that the Gutenberg press had, but when people call the Internet the biggest thing since the printing press, there’s a reason they don’t say “biggest thing ever”.</p>
          
          <p>And here we loop back a bit. A technology is not inevitable, or true. It is possible to imagine a world with different politicians and philosophers where the press was never invented, no matter how obvious it is in hindsight. Different thinkers and philosophers cannot change the speed of light, try as they might.</p>
          
          <p>To conclude:</p>
          
          <p>A technology is created by a political person(for there is no such thing as an apolitical person), for purposes influenced by their politics, and will have a political effect.</p>
          
          <p>A scientific discovery is created by a political person(ditto), but they cannot influence the outcome and it remain science. It will have political effects(for our politics is influenced by our view of the world, and science descries the world), but it is not motivated by them.</p>
          
          <p>As such, all technologies have a politics surrounding them which scientific discoveries do not. Some are ones I agree with(the printing press is AWESOME), some are ones I disagree with(water cannons SUCK).</p>
          
          <p>TCP/IP et all are technologies created by people(smart, well paid white guys, typically) with politics(as much as they deny it, because they’re scientists). You can probably say they’ve made a blip in our politics.</p>
          
          <p>They are inherently political, we need to work out what their politics is, what they encourage or discourage, before we use them to solve political problems.</p>
          
          <p>(Again, this only dealt with a small part(one paragraph) of her post. That’s because that’s all I really disagree with. )</p>
