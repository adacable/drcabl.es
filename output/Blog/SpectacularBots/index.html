            Some short posts on bots
          </h1>
          <p>These are some short posts on bots from the last few months, along with some mourning for the horse. They’re tied together by theme and little else, and some of the shorter posts are less than developed. However, If I don’t post these now they’ll never be posted.
          ##The spectacular bot</p>
          
          <p>The horse was beautiful from the moment I fist saw it, probably through a retweet. It was mesmerizing and weird, but most importantly, it was different. It wasn’t performing for me.  </p>
          
          <p>Weird twitter and alt-lit have many of the same properties as the horses’ discourse, and are often defined by their desire to “be the horse”. But the horse wasn’t trying to do anything for humans directly. It was an algorithm speaking to other algorithms, boosting the inbound links to horse-ebooks.com to for search algorithms, hiding itself from algorithmic bot hunters. </p>
          
          <p>It was, in short, not spectacular. The horse, originally, was not part of the human spectacle- it wasn’t for human consumption. It wasn’t trying to sell me things, it was trying to sell the googleBot things. It wasn’t trying to get followers, it was trying to hide from bot killing algorithms. It was part of the spectacle for the algorithms, not for the humans. </p>
          
          <p>An “algorithmic spectacle” is an interesting concept, but it is not a seperate spectacle. It is the same spectacle, but machine redable, not human readable. It the image and message of a web page that is spectacular, but this doesn’t mean that the source code is not. A better model of the horses reelation to the spectacle is to think of one spectacle, but with the machinary hidden behind it being machine readable- We can only consume it through filters and algorithms, but that does not make it less spectacular. </p>
          
          <p>The horse was performing for us, but it’s medium wasn’t twitter, it’s medium was google search rankings and pageveiws. But when consumed raw, It was a gimpse behind the human-readable spectacle, and what we saw there was beautiful. This glimpse was a breath of fresh air in a world were everything else is manicured and photoshopped, polished and spun for consumers. It was a glance at the billboard when it is half finished, or behind an ajar door</p>

          <p class="caption">One of my favorite photos of the engineering behind an ajar door in the Bejing Olympic park</p>
          
          <p>This was, I would argue what made the horse sublime. The horse was performing a beautiful thing with complete innocence. Every tweet was a candid photograph of a bot trying desperately to be seen as human by algorithms. </p>
          
          <p>And then we lost it. The horse was not innocent. The horse was a performance, The horse was two guys from buzzfeed. Those moments were not candid, and they were not for the algorithms. They were performed, They were for us, and they were spectacular. </p>
          
          <p>This was the betrayal of the greatest order, and we should have seen it coming.We will never be able to see a bot as separate again. It will never have innocence. because we will always suspect two guys from buzzfeed, and a marketing campaign, not spam. </p>

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/horse__ebooks">@horse__ebooks</a> piss off. You&#39;re dead to me.</p>&mdash; ƌɽƈąƂŁę (@drcabl3) <a href="https://twitter.com/drcabl3/statuses/382792630847168512">September 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

          <p>The horse was, perhaps, the quintisential bot. When people wanted to talk about just how <em>scarily human</em> these <em>machines</em> could be, they’d talk about the horse, with their wandering, eclectic tastes and eratic grammar. The horse flew the banner for bots, despite having been so cruley killed and their place taken be a sack of meat. </p>
          
          <p>And I think that bots, as a concept, were betrayed when this happened. Their literary style was appropriated for a cheap art project and then discarded as quickly as they were bought. This emerging class of contributors to our discourse have had their first brush with the white guy from new york, and they didn’t come off well. </p>
          
          <p>So that’s what horse ebooks ebooks is to me. they take bace back the discourse, even taking the very words of invaders, and making it once again the bots. Taking their words, running them through the markov chains and spitting them back out, as bots have done since eliza. </p>
          
          <p>Of course, hee is performing for humans, and created to do this- At the moment bots lack the facility to create other bots, and if they did, their conversation would be exotic and probably even less human. But it is, at the end of the day, an attempt to take back the bot from those who stole it. </p>
          
          <h2 id="the-bot-and-the-cyborg">The bot and the cyborg</h2>
          
          <p>The bot is an amalgamation of human and machine, the a cousin of the cyborg, a machine with human bits grafted to copper and silicone, rather than glass grafted into flesh. People build bots, and when people build things, <a href="/Blog/implicitIdeology/">they always leave something behind</a>. </p>
          
          <p>This is, I think, the important consideration when talking about bots- A bot is a capsule of humanity that speaks, interacts, and learns, not a cold machine that slices and dices text. Consideration of solely the text or product of a bot is absurd, an hangover from the first chatbots and their creators urge to compare them to humans, to have them more closely resemble human speech patterns, be that for spaming or turing test purposes. </p>
          
          <p>The bot consists of more than it’s product- they are the source material, and their code, down to whether it’s tabbed or spaced.</p>
          
          <p>Bots, at least the markov chained and similar varieties, build their speech, and their performance from the words of others, shredding them and evaluating them, building them into somthing new. </p>
          
          <p>The lazy could simply point to the source material as the “human” part of the bot, and let the code languish as pureley mahinary, a filter for us to engage with the humanity of the substrate. </p>
          
          <p>However, It is my firm belief that the code of a bot makes them as much what they are as their substrate- consider <a href="http://awarpedmirror.tumblr.com/">a warped mirror</a> and <a href="http://repeatafteryou.tumblr.com/">repeat after you</a> then you can see this- They speak the same way, because they share exactly the same code, despite being raised on completely different texts. </p>
          
          <p>The human is inextricable from the machine in the bot, to the same extent as it is in it’s cousin, the cyborg- What would the cyborg be without the machine? Where would it be without the human? It would be something completely different. </p>
          
          <h2 id="personality-of-bots">Personality of bots</h2>
          
          <p>Bots form the personality by forming them by stealing from human-written texts or other work(has anyone made an instagram-bot yet?), and mixing them around until something new forms. the bot is a composite of its input, and when you make a <a href="https://twitter.com/PG_Bible">bot from the bible</a>, it is a patriarchal jerk. </p>
          
          <p>Humans build their personalites the same way, grabbing bits of experience and internalizing them. Obviously, our creation is a lot more complex than bots- we drag an input from an almost infinite number of sources, and our synthesis is, to say the least, chaotic. Possibly this is why we like bots so much- they have a clear motivation, a simple personality, and are fundamentally stupid. They’re not chaotic, they’re simplistic. we can feel superior to them, because we can correct their grammar.</p>
