          <p>The location our group was assigned, the clocktower car park, was hated completely by our group. We found it ridgid and oppressive, and came away with various plots to destroy it in imaginitve and varied ways. </p>
          
          <p>We were fascinated with the social structures surrounding the carpark- why did people park on the lines? how did people react when it was full? How did the surrounding shops effect the space, and the wider politics of these shops, with chains nesstled next to aging indipendant dry cleaners.</p>
          
          <p>Our first line of examination was to study the lines- flat and mutable, they nontheless projected very ridgid walls upwards and prevented people crossing them. We experimented with making these physical and hilighting these effects, making walls and removable fences to go along these. </p>
          
          <p>The initial concept of park yourself was repurposing the dead space at night for homeless sleeping space, to fold up and return the space to sallerymen when they came in to cheat on the parking for their day jobs. </p>
          
          <p>The finished product, though not as politically explicit as these concepts, still strongly revolves arounr reclaiming space from cars. While the product is at best a proposal or temporary installation, it had a sucessfull and emotional reaction from all who saw it, or saw it presented. </p>
          
          <p>Further details are available in the video of the park yourself talk at greenwich series, an invited speaker evening for interesting projects in and around greenwhich(and london generally)</p>
