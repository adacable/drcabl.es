          <p>Initial research of the world records brief was less than promising. Most of the reccords broken by the group and in online repositories seemed to be quite trivial- often the kind of thing we did every day, simply recorded(the greatest number of breaths held in a specific neibirhood of london), or alternitavley the absurd and easy- Sticking the greatest number of drawing pins in a piece of fruit. </p>
          
          <p>Many of the online repositories seemed to be made up mostly of drunk frat boys breaking “the greatest number of dual pizza slaps in 15 seconds”. </p>
          
          <p>My reaction to this was to hilight these absurdities. I would break many trivial records in a completely arbitry time period(to be decided by how long it takes me to break them).</p>
          
          <p>The production was highly choreographed, with storyboards, multiple reheasals, and camera position plans. Actors and camerapeople were bought in and payed(classmates who were fed with pizza) and a high level of planning was involved throughout.</p>
          
          <p>While I am generally happy with the overall product, my video editing skills are lacking slightly and the homemade steadicam, while a good solution, would have been better replaced by a porffesional model. 
          Compared to previous producitons, my planning was excelent, with the shoot bieng probably the most premeditated event I’ve produced.</p>
