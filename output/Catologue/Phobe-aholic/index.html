          <p>My reaction to the phobe-aholic brief was an attempt to, albiet mildly, simulate the expereince of an ataxaphobic reaction in a neurotypical person. To do this, I concentrated on the moment of transition between order and chaos, attempting to grab the feeling of order slipping away from the user, similar to the feeling of the ground slipping from under you as you fall over. 
          <img src="/images/probe-pack.jpg" alt="&quot;a completed probe pack&quot;" />
          Particularly interesting to this piece is the user research, which was more varied and intensive than usual. Along with standard book and internet research to attempt to find acounts of ataxaphobia, we also used audience participation and probe packs to investigate peoples perceptions of chaos, and these ideas lead us not down the expected rout of producing a user model, but encouraged us to investigate the subjectivity of chaos. </p>
          
          <p>While the prodject was not taylored to users more specific than “neurotypical people”, Care was taken to produce a result that would be safe and non-dammaging for sufferes of epilepsy and ataxaphobia, and other related disabilites. </p>
          
          <p>The final product was an open source projection exibit, not a long distance from my pre-goldsmiths practice- lots of code and staring at computers. However, the things that differentiate this product form previosu work is the research and team based ideation at the beginging, in contrast to previous preferences of working alone. </p>
          
          <p>The project initially used repurposed and hacked PIR sensors and open hardware to provide the sensory element. The politic of this hardware was far better than the later, simpler, versions using a person pressing the space bar, a move borrowed from rAndom International, who refered to using “an intern pointing his mouse at the people”(Creative mornings 2012, Q&amp;A) in place of CV vision. This incorperates elements of current “neo-luddite” and stacktivist labor struggles around mechanical turks and modern warehouse practices into the work.

          <p>The final work is presented as a video with significant amounts of post processing, due to issues with darkening the instalation location sufficiently and auto-exposure on the camera. While this was less than ideal, with music and reasonable editing, the product communicates the intent well.</p>
