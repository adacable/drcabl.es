[These pictures](http://boingboing.net/2013/05/07/a-train-hoppers-photos.html) have been getting at me a lot recently. They’re the beautiful work of a person with an incredible talent and something to say.

They express freedom in its most pure form, being beholden to no-one, having minimal to nil costs(time, money, spoons, social, etc) on most of the things you want to do.

There are only two ways to have this kind of freedom- to stop caring about the demands society places on you, as these people have done, and fall out under society, or buy your way out- pop over the top.

The first requires massive social costs- many people suddenly get cut off from you, you lose the availability of many advantages of society(the safety net, small as it is, and things we take for granted, like bank accounts and library access.).

The second, typically, requires massive amounts of money- You often need to warp the law arround your demands with you, and the only way to do that is money. This is a moral anathema to me, and anyone who’d conceivably choose the second route.

But I don’t think I could do the first- I’m too attached to my privilege, and as much as I feel chafed by society and the obligations it places upon me, I’ll never have little enough to lose to completely drop it all and go bumming for a few years.

However, I still feel chafed by my inability to drop everything and walk out of the door. I think this leads to a bit of my obsession with post-geographical stuff that’s appearing- the 100 things movements, and related life!minimalist trends- Often borrowing from a trend of ultralight backpacking, a movement that I’ve hung on the edges of for a good 5+ years. *

I also have, for lack of a better word, a train** station kink. They fascinate me, And I’d guess that a good 10%+ of my photos are of train stations.

Possibly this because I spend a lot of dead time with a camera on them, and also because they are eminently photographable, with long lines stretching into the distance and everyone from lawyers to migrating students on their platforms.

But I find that freedom is imbued in these places- walking through kings cross yesterday, I hear an announcement for the train on the opposite platform to mine, and nearly ended up on a trip to Edinburgh instead of leeds. 

A third prong of this is my interesting in the Internet as an anti-geographical technology. Time difference aside, I can walk into an internet cafe in bejing and be in the same place as a person in san francisco.

We both occupy two fundementaly similar places- The physical cafe, and the digital “cloud”, a fictional, fundamentally otherworldly place straight out of plato.

If you’re decently read on internet!philosophy, you should be getting the patented digital dualism alarm bells going off right now- We don’t occupy two spaces, of course. We never leave the physical, but our interactions are mediated by the digital. It does, however, lead to what I belive is the fundemental colapse in our models of place.

I’ve got a thing coming about that, but not yet. Probaly more writing to get my thoughts in order.

Anyway, back to freedom. I hope that these technologies serve to sever some of the ties society places on us, by making some previously nessecary ties unessecary(as the train loosened ties to place ), and by making some unessecary ones go away by virtue of assisting in the destruction of the system that perpetuates them.

*There’s a whole thing on nomadism that’s really cool and I want to talk about it, maybe tomorrow, As i seem to be on a blogging binge.

**not just train stations. I also like bus stations, underground stations, airposts and ports. It’s a transport thing.
