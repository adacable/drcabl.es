The super ordinary project was my first project on the course and contains many examples of good intentions that were not followed through as well as lots of work which I have imporoved on.

As a project, it is probably the most highly sketchbooked and documented product in my catologue- my sketchbook and blog still lack project specific work, prefering instead to catologue my non-project specific reading and other work, rather than focusing strictly on a project at a time. 

The final product was not the intended final product, however I decided to priorotise areas of more interest to me when recaping projects, along with completeting the world record. Even so, the final product, a series of photographs, does hilight the issues and memmories tied up in ordinary objects, and the significance we both attach and fail to attach to them- I belive it has a strong theoretical underpinning.

However, I do find issue with the presentation, which was as a result of poor planning on my part- My camera battery failed and the photography quality(on my phone) was therefore poor.

Research for super ordinary mainly centered on  reading around the philosophy of memmory and identity, a practice which has changed throughout the year- now I tend to carry out reading on a personal track, allowing it to have a looser coupling to the projects. In its place, over time I have done more user focused work and research specific to the projects themselves.
