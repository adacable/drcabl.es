short_description: emphasising the trivilaity of reccords
---
Initial research of the world records brief was less than promising. Most of the reccords broken by the group and in online repositories seemed to be quite trivial- often the kind of thing we did every day, simply recorded(the greatest number of breaths held in a specific neibirhood of london), or alternitavley the absurd and easy- Sticking the greatest number of drawing pins in a piece of fruit. 

Many of the online repositories seemed to be made up mostly of drunk frat boys breaking “the greatest number of dual pizza slaps in 15 seconds”. 

My reaction to this was to hilight these absurdities. I would break many trivial records in a completely arbitry time period(to be decided by how long it takes me to break them).

The production was highly choreographed, with storyboards, multiple reheasals, and camera position plans. Actors and camerapeople were bought in and payed(classmates who were fed with pizza) and a high level of planning was involved throughout.

While I am generally happy with the overall product, my video editing skills are lacking slightly and the homemade steadicam, while a good solution, would have been better replaced by a porffesional model. 
Compared to previous producitons, my planning was excelent, with the shoot bieng probably the most premeditated event I’ve produced.
